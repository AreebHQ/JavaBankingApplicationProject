Java Banking Application - Semester Project
This application was developed as Final Project for my Java course.
This is a simple Banking application using Graphical User Interface (JavaFX) with major banking functions like; Account Opening, Closing, Deposit, Withdrwal, Check Balance, Active Account List, Closed Account List etc. 
I tried to make this application as realistic as i could as per my knowledge of Java at that time. Account opening function collects detailed information about the customer and check if the data entered is correct (in case of invalid email domain - invalid name etc) it will pop up the error window. Along side the banking details, it will create a log file for all the activity taking palce in this applicaiton.
